# Paramter Optimization of SVM

Selected dataset is Dry Bean dataset download from <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php?format=&task=cla&att=num&area=&numAtt=greater100&numIns=greater1000&type=&sort=nameUp&view=list" target="_blank">UCI library</a> . 
## About the dataset
Images of 13,611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera.Seven different types of dry beans were used in this research, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type, and structure by the market situation.

# Basic Data Analytics
Some basic Analysis is done on the dataset.
## 1. Datatypes of every column of the dataset: 
The datatypes of attributes is examined and is plotted to depict the variations among columns based on datatypes. <br>
Here 0.5 means that data is numerical and 0 means it is categorical data. <br>

## 2. Percentage of every class present in dataset: 
The distribution of seven classes present in the dataset can be analysed by viewing their percentage in the data. <br>
